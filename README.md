## Broader Impact and Inclusivity Statement

Automatic Differentiation is a powerful tool that automates the calculation of complex derivatives. Our package provides a fast, accurate way to calculate the gradients of functions of many variables.  Using our library correctly reduces the risk of human errors. However, it is important that the users of this software read the documentation before use. Misuse of our package could introduce errors into the usersâ€™ calculations, potentially invaliding their results. It is a well-documented phenomenon in human factors engineering that humans are less skeptical of results when they come from a machine automated algorithm. In risk adverse fields it is important that the users of this package validate their results to make sure they are using it correctly. 

Our automatic differentiation library is easily accessible to anyone who has access to PyPI. Hosting code on PyPI makes it easy to install with a single line, thus removing barriers to use. We aim to make the library even more user friendly by providing adequate documentation. This documentation explains how to use the package, and the relevant mathematical concepts in a clear, concise manner. Thus, you do not need to be a Python expert or a mathematician to use our library. Those wishing to contribute can request access and submit a pull request to our GitHub repo.
