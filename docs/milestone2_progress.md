## Division of Tasks
We have proposed the follow division of tasks. Of course, the actual distribution of work may change due to scheduling of each of the team members.

#### Test Cases
* We are operating under the philosophy that everyone will "own" their code, meaning that everyone should write tests for the code they write.
* Making sure the Travis CI pipeline and code coverage stays above 90% - Jeremy

#### Creation of Elementary Operations
* Addition - Rima
* Subtraction - Rima 
* Division - Rudra 
* Multiplication  - Jeremy
* Power - Fiona 
* Negation - Fiona 

#### Creation of Elementary Functions & Derivatives 
* Sin - Rima 
* Cos - Rudra
* Tan - Jeremy 
* Arc sin - Rima
* Arc cos - Rudra
* Arc tan - Jeremy 
* Sinh - Rima  
* Cosh - Rudra
* Tanh - Jeremy
* Ln - Fiona
* Log with any base - Fiona 
* Square root - Fiona 

#### Documentation
* Consistent with the philosophy above, everyone will write documentation and comments for the code that they write
* Rima oversees documentation and fills in gaps 
## Progress
* Rudra: Added more information about how to calculate `v_deriv` in a subsection called "Calculating `v_deriv`" in the "implementation" section.
* Jeremy: Modifications to Travis CI and pipeline to ensure support for upcoming development cycle. Started implementation of elementary operations
* Fiona: Project architecture and design. Started implementation of elementary functions and derivatives.
* Rima: Project architecture and design. Started implementation of elementary functions and derivatives.
